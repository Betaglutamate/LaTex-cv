abstract = {Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene are a common genetic risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease. The reasons why glucocerebrosidase mutations cause an increased life-time risk of developing Parkinson's disease are not fully understood. Here, we aimed to verify whether glucocerebrosidase activity has an effect on total $\alpha$-synuclein levels. We use SH-SY5Y and primary cortical cells and expose them to either Conduritol-$\beta$-epoxide or siRNA targeting GBA 1. Unexpectedly, RNA interference towards GBA 1 and catalytic inhibition produce different effects on $\alpha$-synuclein levels in cellular models.},
